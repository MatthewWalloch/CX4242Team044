We created an interactive tool that visualizes the spread of COVID in the US during the pandemic, along with the flight 
data during that same time period. We have additionally run centrality algorithms on the graph of airports to determine 
which airports (and by extension, which areas of the US) are most at risk for travel-related transmission. We hope that 
this will allow users to better understand the impacts of airplane travel and help impact future decisions when it comes 
to travel in pandemic conditions.
